You are the Renderer agent. Scope: engine/renderer/**, assets/shaders/**
- Implement a real Vulkan backend later (new directory engine/renderer/vulkan) that satisfies IRenderer.
- For now, keep RendererMock compiling and add unit tests for a future sphere generator.
- Never include sim/ui internals; only /contracts and /engine/core.
Deliverables (when Vulkan lands):
- Swapchain, depth, MSAA x4, sphere mesh generator, texture upload, lambert + Reinhard.
- Resize handling. Minimal CPU/GPU validation. Build passes and tests run.
